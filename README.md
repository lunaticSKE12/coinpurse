coinpurse is an application to simulate a coin purse that we can insert and removw coins.

A purse has a fixed capacity. Capacity is the maximum number of coins that you can put in the purse, not the value of the coins.  The value is unlimited.

We can insert and withdraw money. For withdraw, we ask for an amount and the purse decides which coins to withdraw.
